/**
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* b/{{name}} * {{name}} Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration. Cloud Storage bucket IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member. IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:storage/bucketIAMBinding:BucketIAMBinding editor "b/{{bucket}} roles/storage.objectViewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:storage/bucketIAMBinding:BucketIAMBinding editor "b/{{bucket}} roles/storage.objectViewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:storage/bucketIAMBinding:BucketIAMBinding editor b/{{bucket}}
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
